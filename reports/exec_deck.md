# 1) Funnel Health: Cohorts & Retention

- Signups by cohort and 12-week retention trends
- Key cohorts: W4/W8 retention highlights and segment outliers
- Drivers: device/channel; seasonality implications

# 2) LTV by Segment: Prioritize ROI

- 6/12-month predicted LTV by device/country/channel
- Concentration: top 10% users cover X% revenue
- Action: allocate paid spend toward high-ROI segments

# 3) Experiment Design: Power/MDE + CUPED

- Power calculators for rates/means with sensible defaults
- CUPED reduces variance by 15–40% in pre-post settings
- Impact: smaller MDE or shorter test duration

# 4) Uplift Targeting → Net Revenue Lift

- Two-Model uplift detects persuadable segments
- Qini/AUUC better than random targeting
- Simulator: discount %, margin, audience cap → net lift

# 5) Roadmap

- Doubly robust and causal forests for uplift
- Hierarchical LTV across geos and channels
- Improved retention segmentation and alerting
- Online evaluation + automated experiment sizing
